# False Color Imagery and the 2017 Thomas Fire

Kimberlee Wong - November 23, 2024

## About

This repository includes two notebooks. Each notebook has the vital steps that were taken in order to get to the final product of a false color imagery map that includes the perimeter of the 2017 Thomas Fire. The hwk4-task2-fire-perimeter-wong.ipynb notebook includes the code that was used to achieve the Thomas Fire perimeter by filtering a dataset that had information on many California fires. The hwk4-task2-false-color-wong.ipynb notebook has the code that was used to visualize the landsat data and overlay the perimeter on top. There is a data folder that only includes the Thomas Fire boundary that was made, for the landsat data was accessible through the server.
